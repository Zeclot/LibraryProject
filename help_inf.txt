This program have multiple commands that you can use.
The command will follow from a list of potential commands.
- list/List: Lists all the files in the current directory
- shelf/Self: Shows all the shelf and there content
- read/Read: Will continue to ask you what you want to read about in the library
- help/Help: Will give you this text again
- rnd: Will give you random knowledge from the library
- exit/Exit: Stops the program
I hope these commands have been good.
