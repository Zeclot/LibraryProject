To use strings one needs to first include the string packaged.
This is done by the command.

#include <string>

Once this is done one can easily create a string by using the cast system.

string my_string;

! One thing with strings is that they do not work in switch conditions. This
is because the switch statement only works for integers in c++. See further information
about the switch statement in the switch file.
